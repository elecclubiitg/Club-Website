                            At the start of every semester, the club will send out a list of projects via email to all members. This list will include a variety of projects that are currently being worked on, as well as new projects that the club is planning to take on. 
                            <br><br>
                            Students are welcome to apply for any of the projects on the list by filling out an application form. We encourage juniors to consider the projects that align with their interests and skills and apply as soon as possible to secure a spot on the team.

Our mentors are experienced members of the club who will provide you with the support and guidance you need to succeed. They will be available to answer any questions, provide feedback, and offer suggestions on how to improve your work.

                            With the help of your mentor, you will have the opportunity to learn from someone who has been in your shoes and can provide valuable insights and advice.

                            If for any reason a student misses the deadline to apply for a project, they need not worry. Opportunities to join a project can arise throughout the semester and we encourage students to reach out to one of the club core team members or heads to inquire about joining a project. We understand that circumstances can change and we want to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to be a part of our projects. 
                            <br><br>
                            By contacting a core team member or head, students can express their interest in a project, and if a spot becomes available, they will be considered for it. So, even if you missed the deadline to apply, don't hesitate to reach out and let us know that you are still interested in joining a project, we are here to help.
